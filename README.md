# Regicide Solo 
by Harrison Chen
version: 1.1

Regicide Solo is a Terminal text program for the solo version of the Regicide card game designed by Badger Games. Hope to implement GUI and multiplayer later.

Read the rules: https://www.badgersfrommars.com/assets/RegicideRulesA4.pdf

Type JOKER instead of playing a card to use a joker.

# To Play
1. Open Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt on Windows
2. Type 'java -jar '
3. Drag the regicide-master.jar file into the console window
    the full command should look something like: 'java -jar /Users/yourname/...[folder you downloaded this to].../regicide-master/regicide-master.jar'
4. Press enter
